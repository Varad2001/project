### To-Do/Problems:

1. can't load the entire dataset. This model was trained and tested on only 5000 records.
In these 5000 records, all the languages do not have equal no. of entries.

2. there are 22 languages in the dataset. we need to decide if we want to take all of them or some selected ones.

3. check if all languages are predicted correctly or not.

4. more data cleaning needs to be done, like removing punctuations, special symbols (@, #, $, etc.), etc.

5. write a function for 3.

6. trying different algorithms and compare their results to see which suits our case the best.

7. any further improvements/features, etc.
